The Personal Expense Tracker is a simple console-based Java application designed to help users record, view, search, and manage their daily expenses efficiently.
It demonstrates practical use of Core Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, and Collections while providing a real-world use case suitable for beginners and students.

Users can enter their daily spending details — category, amount, date, and notes — and the program saves the data in a text file (expenses.txt).
The saved records can later be viewed, searched, or deleted directly from the console interface.
